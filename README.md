Loan Approval Classification
Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on loan approval classification. The goal of this project is to build and deploy a predictive model that can assess whether a loan application is likely to be approved or denied based on various features and historical data.

Problem Statement
Lending institutions receive numerous loan applications daily, and efficiently evaluating each application is crucial. This project addresses the challenge of automating the loan approval process by developing a machine learning model that can predict loan approval outcomes with high accuracy. The model will assist in making informed decisions, reducing manual effort, and improving the overall efficiency of the lending process.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is found in this repo. It contains a diverse set of features, including applicant information, credit history, financial indicators, and more. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables for modeling purposes.

Model Selection
Multiple machine learning algorithms are explored and compared to identify the best-performing model. Algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks are considered. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess model performance.
